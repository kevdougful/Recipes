# Broccoli Chicken Stir Fry
###### [Adapted from Alton Brown's Recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/chicken-and-broccoli-stir-fry-recipe.html)

###### Ingredients
* 1 lb chicken breast, cubed
* 3 scallions, whites only, thinly sliced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 inch piece of ginger, minced
* 1 tbsp low sodium soy sauce
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1 tbsp + 1 tsp corn starch
* 1 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp sherry
* 1 tbsp dark toasted sesame oil
* 1/3 - 1/2 cup water
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* 5-6 cups broccoli, trimmed sliced stalks and medium florets (keep separate)
* 3/4 - 1 tsp red chili flakes (optional)
* 1 tbsp hoisin sauce

###### Directions
1. Combine scallion whites, half the ginger and half the garlic, soy sauce, sugar, 1 tsp cornstarch, sherry, and sesame oil in a medium bowl.  Marinate chicken in this mixture for about 15 minutes at room temp.
2. Heat a large skillet over high heat.  Add 1 tbsp oil and stir-fry for about 30 seconds.  Add remaining garlic and ginger with the florets along with 2 tbsp of water and salt and pepper to taste.  Stir-fry until the broccoli is bright green but still crisp (~2 mins).  Transfer to a plate.
3. Get the skillet hot again and then add 2 tbsp oil.  Add the chicken and chili flakes if using.  Stir-fry until the chicken loses its raw color and gets a little brown (~3 mins).  Add the hoisin sauce and return the broccoli to the pan and toss to heat through.  Mix the remaining corn starch in 1/3 cup water and add to the pan.  Boil to thicken, add more water if necessary.
4. Serve with rice.  You make garnish with additional scallions and toasted sesame seeds.
